need an user collection which should be feeded with chatSessions which user
belongs or belonged in some point in time.

need a collection for store chat chatSessions



ideally we would have a collection of messages also | just point out to messages document on chatSession.messages
but initially lets just implement messages collection


do we need firebase admin to manage users?!

when a new user is created, we should create a new entry on usersCollection
create the default chat sessions and share it all around the users;

implement chatSessions collection to boostrap chatSessions to new users.
